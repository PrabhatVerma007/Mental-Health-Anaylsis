# 📘 Mental Health Text Classification using DistilBERT

This project builds a mental health text classifier using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model. It focuses on identifying the mental health status expressed in user-generated text through NLP techniques and transformer-based classification, while addressing data imbalance using augmentation and loss weighting.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: Combined mental health text dataset (`Combined Data.csv`)
- **Features**:  
  - `statement`: Free-text input  
  - `status`: Labeled mental health category  
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Dropped NaN and duplicate statements
  - Label encoding applied to status categories

## 🧠 Model

- **Architecture**: DistilBERT with classification head
- **Tokenizer**: `DistilBertTokenizer`
- **Augmentation**:
  - Using `nlpaug` (if available)
  - Fallback: synonym replacement and word swaps
- **Loss Handling**:
  - Class weights computed using `compute_class_weight` (Sklearn)
  - Optional: Focal Loss (if implemented in later cells)

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
pip install -U transformers datasets nlpaug
```

## 🚀 How to Run

Clone this repository and open the notebook `Mental_Health_OP.ipynb`

Ensure `Combined Data.csv` is in the correct directory

Run the notebook step-by-step:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Tokenization and dataset creation
- Model training using HuggingFace `Trainer`
- Evaluation using metrics like F1, Accuracy, ROC-AUC

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- F1 Score (weighted)
- Precision & Recall
- ROC AUC
